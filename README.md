## UPDATES:
*version 0.6*
- Introduces the DatabaseConfig class in the config.py file, providing a unified interface for managing multiple database connections (local SQLite, remote Turso, and LibSQL sync operations). See the dedicated section below for more details.
- Market data is now updated more frequently, every two hours.
- Several performance improvements. Among the most significant is a complete  rework of the build cost engine. Calculating build costs for 50+ structures was by far the slowest thing in the app. The new async approach makes this dramatically faster by asyncrously calculating costs for several structures at once. In this update, the async build cost functionality moves out of experimental and is now the default option.
- The app also gets a new backend, which can be found in the seperate [mkts-backend repo][mkts-backend-link] on GitHub. This update moves handling of ESI calls and database updates into automated GitHub actions.

- Known issue: Hurricane Fleet Issue doctrine is not yet configured in Doctrine report. Support ships are the same as CFI, so you can use it as a proxy until I get around to updating it.

*version 0.52*
- introduced experimental async API calls for builds and several other refactors for performance improvement and maintainability. Helpers.py added with useful functions for development and debugging.
- added comparison structure option to build cost tool, automatic calculation of structure tax based on stored data.
- implemented rate limiting and proper user agent headers for API calls

## Data Updates

The app uses Turso's embedded-replica feature to allow a local SQLlite-libsql database that allows extremely fast data fetches. The application automatically syncs with EVE Online market stored on the parent database daily at 13:00 UTC. Users can also trigger manual updates using the sync button in the sidebar to obtain new data, if it is available.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wc_mkts_streamlit.git
cd wc_mkts_streamlit
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your_turso_database_url
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_auth_token
SDE_URL=your_sde_url
SDE_AUTH_TOKEN=your_sde_auth_token
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. **Filtering Data**
   - Use the sidebar filters to select specific categories or items
   - Toggle "Show All Data" to view all market orders

2. **Viewing Market Data**
   - Select an item to view detailed market information

   - Choose material price source (ESI Average, Jita Sell, Jita Buy)
   - Compare costs across different structures
   - Analyze profit margins against market prices
   - Enable async mode for faster calculations

## DatabaseConfig Class

The `DatabaseConfig` class is a centralized configuration manager that handles multiple database connections and operations. It provides a unified interface for working with local SQLite databases, remote Turso databases, and LibSQL synchronization.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Database Support**: Manages connections to multiple databases (market data, SDE, build costs)
- **Dual Environment Support**: Handles both local SQLite and remote Turso database connections
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Provides LibSQL sync capabilities for keeping local and remote databases in sync
- **Lazy Loading**: Database connections are created only when needed using properties
- **Validation**: Includes sync validation to ensure data consistency

### Database Aliases

The class supports the following database aliases:

| Alias | Description | Local File | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `wcmkt2` | Production market database | `wcmkt2.db` | Main market data and orders |
| `wcmkt3` | Testing market database | `wcmkt3.db` | Development and testing |
| `sde` | Static Data Export | `sde.db` | EVE Online static data (items, categories) |
| `build_cost` | Build cost calculations | `buildcost.db` | Structure data and industry indexes |

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Initialization
```python
from config import DatabaseConfig

# Create a database configuration
mkt_db = DatabaseConfig("wcmkt2")  # Production market database
sde_db = DatabaseConfig("sde")     # Static data export
build_db = DatabaseConfig("build_cost")  # Build cost database
```

#### Database Connections

The class provides several connection methods through properties:

```python
# Local SQLite connection (SQLAlchemy engine)
local_engine = mkt_db.engine

# Remote Turso connection (SQLAlchemy engine)
remote_engine = mkt_db.remote_engine

# LibSQL local connection
libsql_conn = mkt_db.libsql_local_connect

# LibSQL sync connection (for synchronization)
sync_conn = mkt_db.libsql_sync_connect

# Direct SQLite connection
sqlite_conn = mkt_db.sqlite_local_connect
```

#### Synchronization

```python
# Sync local database with remote Turso database
mkt_db.sync()

# Validate sync was successful
is_valid = mkt_db.validate_sync()
```

#### Database Inspection

```python
# Get list of tables
tables = mkt_db.get_table_list(local_only=True)

# Get column information for a specific table
columns = mkt_db.get_table_columns("marketorders", local_only=True)

# Get detailed column information
detailed_columns = mkt_db.get_table_columns("marketorders", local_only=True, full_info=True)
```

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `alias` | str | Database alias identifier |
| `path` | str | Local file path to the database |
| `url` | str | SQLAlchemy connection URL for local database |
| `turso_url` | str | Remote Turso database URL |
| `token` | str | Authentication token for Turso |
| `engine` | Engine | SQLAlchemy engine for local database (lazy-loaded) |
| `remote_engine` | Engine | SQLAlchemy engine for remote database (lazy-loaded) |
| `libsql_local_connect` | Connection | LibSQL local connection (lazy-loaded) |
| `libsql_sync_connect` | Connection | LibSQL sync connection (lazy-loaded) |
| `sqlite_local_connect` | Connection | Direct SQLite connection (lazy-loaded) |

### Methods

#### `sync()`
Synchronizes the local database with the remote Turso database using LibSQL's embedded-replica feature.

**Features:**
- Updates local database with latest remote data
- Updates Streamlit session state with sync timestamps
- Validates sync success for market databases
- Updates saved sync state

#### `validate_sync() -> bool`
Validates that the sync was successful by comparing the `last_update` timestamp between local and remote databases.

**Returns:** `True` if sync was successful, `False` otherwise

#### `get_table_list(local_only: bool = True) -> list[str]`
Retrieves a list of table names from the database.

**Parameters:**
- `local_only`: If `True`, uses local database; if `False`, uses remote database

**Returns:** List of table names (excluding SQLite system tables)

#### `get_table_columns(table_name: str, local_only: bool = True, full_info: bool = False) -> list`
Retrieves column information for a specific table.

**Parameters:**
- `table_name`: Name of the table to inspect
- `local_only`: If `True`, uses local database; if `False`, uses remote database
- `full_info`: If `True`, returns detailed column information; if `False`, returns just column names

**Returns:**
- If `full_info=False`: List of column names
- If `full_info=True`: List of dictionaries with column details (cid, name, type, notnull, dflt_value, pk)

### Configuration

The class uses Streamlit secrets for Turso configuration:

```python
# Required secrets in .streamlit/secrets.toml
[wcmkt2_turso]
url = "your_turso_url"
token = "your_auth_token"

[wcmkt3_turso]
url = "your_turso_url"
token = "your_auth_token"

[sde_aws_turso]
url = "your_turso_url"
token = "your_auth_token"

[buildcost_turso]
url = "your_turso_url"
token = "your_auth_token"
```

### Error Handling

The class includes proper error handling for:
- Invalid database aliases
- Missing Streamlit secrets
- Database connection failures
- Sync validation failures

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Database connections are only created when first accessed
- **Connection Reuse**: Connections are cached and reused for subsequent operations
- **Efficient Sync**: Uses LibSQL's optimized sync mechanism for minimal bandwidth usage
- **Validation**: Sync validation is only performed for market databases to avoid unnecessary checks
